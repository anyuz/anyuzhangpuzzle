# Understanding the puzzle

We highly recommend that you take a few dedicated minutes to read this README in its entirety before starting to think about potential solutions. You'll probably find it useful to review the codebase and understand the system at a high-level before attempting to find specific bugs.

# Bugs

Imagine you're on an engineering team that is building an eCommerce site where users can buy and sell items (similar to Etsy or eBay). One of the developers on your team has put together a very simple prototype for a system that writes and reads to a database. The developer is using Postgres for the backend database, the Python Flask framework as an application server, and nginx as a web server. All of this is developed with the Docker Engine, and put together with Docker Compose.

Unfortunately, the developer is new to many of these tools, and is having a number of issues. The developer needs your help debugging the system and getting it to work properly.

# Fix processes

The codebase included in this repo is nearly functional, but has a few bugs that are preventing it from working properly. The goal of this puzzle is to find these bugs and fix them. To do this, you'll have to familiarize yourself with the various technologies (Docker, nginx, Flask, and Postgres) enough to figure out  You definitely don't have to be an expert on these, but you should know them well enough to understand what the problem is.

Assuming you have the Docker Engine and Docker Compose already installed, the developer said that the steps for running the system is to open a terminal, `cd` into this repo, and then enter these two commands:

    docker-compose up -d db
    docker-compose run --rm flaskapp /bin/bash -c "cd /opt/services/flaskapp/src && python -c  'import database; database.init_db()'"

This "bootstraps" the PostgreSQL database with the correct tables. After that you can run the whole system with:

    docker-compose up -d

At that point, the web application should be visible by going to `localhost:8080` in a web browser. 

Once you've corrected the bugs and have the basic features working, commit the functional codebase to a new repo following the instructions below. As you debug the system, you should keep track of your thought process and what steps you took to solve the puzzle.

## Refactoring
* Don't schedule your interview until you've worked on the puzzle 
* To submit your entry please use the link you received in your systems puzzle invitation
* You will only be able to submit through the link one time
* For security, we will not open solutions submitted via files
* Use the submission box to enter the link to your GitHub repo or Bitbucket ONLY
* Link to the specific repo for this project, not your general profile
* Put any comments in the README inside your project repo
